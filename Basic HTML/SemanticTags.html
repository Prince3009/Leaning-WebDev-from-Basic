<!-- Semantic tags in HTML are elements that provide meaning and structure to the content of a web page. They help search engines, screen readers, and other tools understand the purpose of different parts of the page, improving accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). Here are some common semantic tags in HTML:

<header>: Defines a header for a section or a page.

<nav>: Represents a section with navigation links.

<main>: Specifies the main content of a document.

<article>: Represents an independent piece of content that can stand alone.

<section>: Defines sections within a document.
    
<aside>: Represents content that is related to the surrounding content.

<footer>: Defines a footer for a section or a page.

<figure>: Represents content like images, illustrations, diagrams, code snippets, etc., with optional captions.

<figcaption>: Provides a caption or legend for a <figure> element.

<time>: Represents a specific time or a range of time.

<address>: Represents contact information for its nearest <article> or <body> ancestor.
    
Using these semantic tags appropriately can improve the readability of your HTML code and make it easier for both humans and machines to understand the structure and purpose of your web page. -->
