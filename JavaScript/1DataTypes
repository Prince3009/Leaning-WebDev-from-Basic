// Numbers: Represent both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: 5, 6.5, 7 etc.

// String: A string is a sequence of characters. In JavaScript, strings can be enclosed within the single or double quotes. Example: “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.

// Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

// Null: This type has only one value : null.

// Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.

// Symbol: Unlike other primitive data types, it does not have any literal form. It is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol-that is unique. 

// BigInt: The Bigint type represents the whole numbers that are larger than 253-1. To form a BigInt literal number, you append the letter n at the end of the number.

// Object: It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn about these data types in detail in further articles.
